My solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) this year

# Debugging

For VSCode language support and debugging install:

- [Ruby LSP](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Shopify.ruby-lsp)
- [VSCode rdbg Ruby Debugger](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=KoichiSasada.vscode-rdbg)

Ensure you execute configuration commands in a terminal with high enough privileges, seems to work on Administrator Command Prompt but not the Command Prompt integrated VSCode terminal

# Formatting

Formatting uses rubocop
